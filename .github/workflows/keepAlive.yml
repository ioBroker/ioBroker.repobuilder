name: Trigger keep-alive commits
#
# GitHub suspends scheduled worklflows for inactive repositories. This worklflow is triggered according to cron schedule and performs an empty commit. 
# This ensures that the repository is no longer considered stale by GitHub and thus avoids stopping workflow processing.
