name: Trigger keep-alive commits
#
# GitHub suspends scheduled workflows for inactive repositories. An repository is consired inactive if there was no commit within the last 60 days. This worklflow is triggered according to cron schedule and performs an empty commit. 
# This ensures that the repository is no longer considered stale by GitHub and thus avoids stopping workflow processing.
